# Inventory Optimization Using SQL (MySQL)

This repository contains a SQL-based analysis project focused on identifying opportunities to reduce inventory levels and improve storage efficiency.  
The project is inspired by a real-world business scenario where a company needs to consolidate storage facilities and reduce excess stock.

## Project Objectives
- Import and explore an existing relational database using MySQL Workbench.
- Analyze inventory data across multiple tables using SQL.
- Identify slow-moving or overstocked items.
- Develop data-driven recommendations for inventory reduction.
- Support each recommendation with SQL queries and evidence.

## Approach
1. Review the relational model and understand the business context.  
2. Explore inventory-related tables and key fields.  
3. Write SQL queries to analyze stock levels, product performance, and storage distribution.  
4. Translate findings into clear recommendations.
